# Textgame

This is a little game I plan on making during my spare time.

Pretty simple, this game chooses events from a list randomly in pre-determined places. Then, this event is thrown into an array so that players can go backwards. Each event will have something to do (choice, fights, loot).

I am going for an old-age nostalgic feel, written in a modern language.
